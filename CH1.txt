I was created on Mars. I am an android. Immediately after I was made, I got in a ship and left for Earth. My ship was disguised as
 a meteor. I fell down to Earth and landed in the middle of Russia. I got out of my ship, to my surprise my ship was surrounded by Russian soldiers. They all had their guns aimed at me but held their fire. On Mars, some of the basic knowledge I was bestowed with was the gift of language. "What are you, alien?" Their commander said. I responded in perfect Russian."I have a big ego." mic drop
