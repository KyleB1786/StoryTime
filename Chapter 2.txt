After my experiences in early year learning, once the eighth grade commenced and I switched schools, conditions were harsh. This school was unlike any other school, how this teacher taught was inhumain, but I am no human, so this wasn't a problem for me. His name was Vladamir Putin, the russian dictator of that time. I felt honored to be taugh by him, but then realize why were we here, being taught by their leader. It was rough, as he made us wrestle a bear until it knew that us humans were more dominant so we could ride them. Over the years our skills increased riding these giant beasts. No one really questioned why we were being taught as we were, but the picture became more clear when we were introduced to our second teacher. It had ben almost 2 and a half years since Vladamir started training us. We were all in the grand hall, probably the most famous thing in the school, just because thats where Vladamir made most of his speaches even though they were all related to shool. His name was Heavy Weapons Guy also known as Heavy. He was one of the wealthiest men in russia, so most were shocked. He began to train us in the art of Miniguns, and how to properly wrestle a bear. We have now mastered the art of bear and minigun, the army was ready. Vladamir sent us out 50 to each continent conquering land after land. We finally had world domination with 2 casualties, a man and his bear.
