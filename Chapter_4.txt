As an elderly man I finally reached my peak. I had a frail body and a flimsy mind but blossomed none the less.
 By the time I had reached 104 years old the internet had become so advanced you could live inside it. 
 While the others topk advantage of this I kept to myself and began a new career as the elderly soap carver.
 Poeple would bring me the finest soaps in all of Futuremerica.
 Sadly this career didn't last long, Whipping the soap into shape with my 53" bowie knife repeatedly gave me flashback of when I had been a navy seal in the war of 2029 against Putin's terminators.
 Eventually I knew my time had come, I felt for my final hours I should return to my fastherland, Mother Russia. 
 In the midst of a fight with a bear in the frozen Russian mountains I met my mortal end. 
 As a ghost...
