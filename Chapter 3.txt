As an adult I start to develop your new vision of the real world. Also I have reached a good level of maturity and respectful manners. As an adult I have a lot of responsibilities. I have to feed my family and I had to get a full-time job in order to help them. Even though russia has conquered earth, we got back to human "normal" day life. I decided to be a teacher. Since I was from outer space, I decided to teach astronomy and other planetary related courses. Nobody really questioned my knowlege on the planet Mars due to the recent rover landings on that planet. It was fun for a while, but year after year of teaching the same thing to diferent students, I got bored. Wondering what to do, I cut off half of the time I spent teaching to try new jobs. Nothing really interested me how astronomy did, until I went to an abservatory. It was amazing, and fun too. I asked them if they had any job openings at their observatory using my experience as an astronomy teacher they asked around and let me clean/repair the telescopes.
